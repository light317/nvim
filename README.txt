 -- GENERAL USAGE --

 - To add new packages, go to packer.lua, and add it there. Usually the repo of the packages will have the commands there.

 - Once done. Type: ":so" to source packer.lua, then type: ":PackerSync" to install it. 

 - After installing the package, if you need to make any remaps or configurations, go to: ./plugin/after/ and create a lua file for it, ie: telescope.lua
